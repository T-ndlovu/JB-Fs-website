    <h2>DELIVERY POLICY</h2>

    <p>Check the dimensions of the space in which the product will be placed. Please Check our website or Ask your
        consultant for sizes and dimensions.

        Measure any staircase, doorways and corridors the product will have to pass through, including space for
        maneuvering and turning. As an environmentally conscious company, we at JB Furniture Store make every effort to
        recycle our waste. Our delivery crews will remove and retain all protective packaging used during transportation
        of goods to your home.

        Please ensure that our delivery vehicles are given safe and ample space and access to offload

        (especially in complexes and residential estates). Please let us know when placing your order if there are any
        access restrictions or special needs, which must be considered to ensure a successful delivery.

        For further information regarding our deliveries and requirements, please contact your nearest store and speak
        to one of our sales consultants who will be able to assist you.</p>

    <h2>COLLECTING AT A STORE</h2>

    <p>Lead time from our Warehouse to the selected store is dependent on stock availability and store location. Please
        ask our store consultant to advise on lead time. The store will arrange and confirm the collection with the
        customer.The customer or person collecting the product must produce the original invoice in order for JB
        Furniture Store to release the product. The person producing the original invoice shall be deemed to be the duly
        authorized agent of the customer. Unless indicated to the contrary on the collection note it is deemed that the
        product has been collected and received in good condition and, where appropriate in accordance with the
        customer’s specifications.<br>

        The authorized collecting agent must sign the OCI document and produce a valid identity document when collecting
        the goods. JB Furniture Store will not in any way be liable for damages that may occur after the products have
        been handed to the customer or person collecting on behalf of the customer or during the loading and conveyance
        thereof. It’s the customer’s responsibility to ensure that a suitable collection vehicle is utilized in order to
        accommodate the size of the product in an upright position and that it is loaded and secure to prevent
        damage.<br>

        The customer is also responsible for supplying the necessary consumables e.g. rope and blankets to stabilize the
        product during transportation
